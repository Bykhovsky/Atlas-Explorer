**Atlas Explorer** is an advanced in-game developer suite for Roblox — built to help creators visualize, debug, and optimize their games *directly inside the live environment*.  

It provides real-time insights into your workspace, performance, and scripts with the goal of becoming the **must-have tool for all Roblox developers**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Atlas Explorer acts as a multi-panel diagnostic and inspection utility that extends the Roblox experience with developer-grade tools.  
Think of it as a hybrid between **Roblox Studio’s Explorer** and **Unity’s Profiler**, but accessible *in-game* and *runtime-aware*.

Key capabilities include:

- 🔍 **Live Instance Explorer** — browse and manipulate the DataModel in real time.  
- ⚙️ **Property Inspector** — edit and monitor instance properties dynamically.  
- 🧠 **Debug Utilities** — visualize object lifecycles, detect leaks, and inspect UI Z-order and layout issues.  
- ⚡ **Performance Metrics** — monitor frame time, memory, network throughput, and garbage collection.  
- 📡 **Remote Traffic Tools** *(optional)* — track server/client RemoteEvent and RemoteFunction usage for debugging replication and latency.  
- 🧩 **Extendable Architecture** — add custom modules for your own game systems or debugging workflows.

## 🧩 Module Structure

Atlas Explorer is organized into modular services, making it easy to extend or disable features.

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
|`APIService` |  |
|`AtlasClipboard` |  |
|`AtlasContextMenu` |  |
|`AtlasCore` |  |
|`AtlasDrag` |  |
|`AtlasIcons` |  |
|`AtlasId` |  |
|`AtlasObjectBrowser` |  |
|`AtlasProperties` |  |
|`AtlasTree` |  |

> Each module is sandboxed and uses a lightweight signal/event pipeline to minimize overhead.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Atlas Explorer was designed around three pillars:

1. Transparency — expose what’s really happening in your game. 
2. Control — empower developers to fix and optimize issues on the fly. 
3. Extensibility — serve as a foundation for future debugging and visualization tools. 

This project isn’t just for convenience — it’s about making *runtime diagnostics accessible to every Roblox developer*.
